 The mesh of area 4 contains PLANE182 triangles, which are much too      
 stiff in bending.  Use quadratic (6- or 8-node) elements if possible.   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.118   TIME= 12:05:38
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.

 stiff in bending.  Use quadratic (6- or 8-node) elements if possible.   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     906.484   TIME= 19:36:25
 Shape testing revealed that 2 of the 1012 new or modified elements      
 violate shape warning limits.  To review test results, please see the   
 output file or issue the CHECK command.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     906.672   TIME= 19:36:25
 Both solid model and finite element model boundary conditions have been 
 applied to this model.  As solid loads are transferred to the nodes or  
 elements, they can overwrite directly applied loads.                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =     906.797   TIME= 19:36:25
 Previous testing revealed that 2 of the 1012 selected elements violate  
 shape warning limits.  To review warning messages, please see the
